Use your index finger to draw on a blackboard. Integrating computer vision and Pygame
Using googles mediapipe, opencv and pygame, you can use your index finger from 3 dimensions, and it will map it onto a 2 dimensional screen. You can then start drawing on a mini blackboard created by pygame. 

To screenshot, bring your index finger and touch it to tip of middle finger. To draw bring your tip of index finger to tip of thumb and move across screen.
